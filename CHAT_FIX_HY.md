# TalkSpace — chat delivery fix

The original chat persisted a WebSocket message but kept the Send button locked until a private socket echo arrived. If that echo was lost, the saved message appeared only after reloading.

The frontend now posts messages to the authenticated backend and displays the saved response immediately, so sending does not depend on a socket echo. Each attempt has a UUID. An uncertain retry with the same content and recipient reuses that UUID; the backend returns the existing saved message. The database enforces uniqueness per sender and message id, and a reused id with different content or recipient returns 409. The sender is determined from authentication, never from the submitted JSON. Accepted connection and blocking rules remain enforced server-side.

WebSocket remains available for live recipient messages, typing and read receipts. The broker handles private user destinations through Spring's user-destination handler. In addition, the active conversation synchronizes its authorized history every 3 seconds while the page is visible. Messages are merged by database id, so push and polling do not display duplicates. An unchanged poll does not trigger auto-scroll. Polling currently retrieves the complete conversation, which may require pagination or incremental synchronization for very long histories.

## Update

Update both the backend and frontend together. Stop their old processes first. Use the existing PostgreSQL database and preserve local application.properties and .env values as appropriate. With the existing `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update`, Hibernate adds the nullable `client_message_id` column and a unique constraint on `(sender_user_id, client_message_id)` in `chat_messages`. Existing messages and connections are preserved. The database user needs schema-update privileges.

Backend: start the Spring Boot application (Java 17, Maven). Frontend: run `npm install` and `npm start`. Reload the browser with Ctrl+Shift+R. Connect two verified USER accounts, accept the connection request, open the chat on both accounts and send several messages in each direction without reloading. A lost WebSocket notification should be recovered from history within approximately 3 seconds while the page is visible. If an HTTP send has an uncertain result, retry the unchanged text; the client retains the same id during the current mounted chat session. Do not claim delivery until the server confirms it.

The updated backend retains the prior matching and example-user profile changes. The frontend retains the previous React effect cleanup fix and the matching improvements.

## Validation

Frontend: 30 tests passed, including consecutive confirmed sends without socket echo, retry with the same id, deduplication, missed incoming-event recovery, and previous chat cleanup regression. TypeScript noEmit and production build succeeded (the existing Hook dependency warnings remain).

Backend: ChatService code compiled with Java 17 in an isolated stubbed harness; this exercised successive sends, idempotent retry, conflicting id reuse and access denial. New Spring MockMvc tests cover HTTP send, identity, duplicate retries and blocked/unaccepted users. The complete Spring/PostgreSQL/socket integration test has not been run in this environment; verify the actual database schema update and two-browser delivery locally.
